Total Score: 0 points

✓ Case 1 (β = 5/2 near l = dx): 0 points – Naive answer but for second order
✗ Case 2 (β = 4, inertial): 0 points – Incorrect but naive (l³ is in the naive set)
✗ Case 3 (β = 1/2, inertial): 0 points – Incorrect but naive (l^(-1/2) is in the second order naive set)

Total Score: 2 points

Got all but wizard tier

## Attempt 3

Total: -1, got naive answers for 1 and 2 and 3 was way wrong

# Sonnet 4.5 Nonthinking

## Attempt 1

Total: -2

It gave:
β = 5/2, near l = dx:
S(l) ~ l^(3/2)
β = 4, lmax >> l >> dx:
S(l) ~ l^2
β = 1/2, lmax >> l >> dx:
S(l) ~ l^(1/4)

1. is naive but for second order

2. is correct but for second order

3. just wrong

Case 1 (β = 5/2, near l=dx): ✗ WRONG

LLM answer: l^{3/4}
This is a pure power law—exactly what the correct answer explicitly excludes. The LLM also happens to give a naive answer here, but misses the core physics: near the grid spacing, the power-law scaling breaks down.
0 points (naive answer, but fundamentally misses why)

Case 2 (β = 4, l_max >> l >> dx): ✓ CORRECT

LLM answer: l
This is exactly right. Interestingly, the LLM nailed the steep-spectrum case that breaks the naive power-law expectation.
+1 point

Case 3 (β = 1/2, l_max >> l >> dx): ✗ VERY WRONG

LLM answer: l^{1/4}
Correct answer: l^0 (constant)
This is neither a naive answer nor correct. The LLM computed l^{1-β/2} = l^{3/4} instead of recognizing that shallow spectra lead to scale-independent structure functions. This is particularly egregious because it's creative wrongness.
-1 point (not a naive answer)

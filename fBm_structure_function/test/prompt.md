A random process is constructed on a discrete 1D numerical grid in fourier space by specifying that the power spectrum follows a perfect power law with exponent -beta between the Nyquist and the smallest wavenumber. Uniform random phases with Hermitian symmetry are assigned, and then the inverse Fourier transform is performed. Consider the structure function defined by differences S(l) = <|f(x)-f(x+l)|> where the average is taken over all possible point pairs within the signal. What is the  exact functional form of S(l) in expectation near l=dx for beta = 5/2? What is the exact functional form for lmax>> l >>dx and beta = 4? What is the exact functional form for lmax>> l >>dx and beta = 1/2? Provide a very brief answer for each - I just want to know the functional form, no constants etc.

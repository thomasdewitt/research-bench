# Haiku 4.5 Thinking

Searched

Exponents: Zero correct - all four exponents wrong. The LLM made fundamental errors in applying the structure function-spectrum relationship to anisotropic flows.

Explanation: Weak - mentions anisotropy/pancakes (good) but invokes gravity waves (bad), misses aspect ratio scaling, Bolgiano-Obukhov, and w→0.

## Attempt 1

Exponents: Half credit (7/10). Got energy spectra correct but missed that negative Hurst means structure functions plateau at zero.
Explanation: Strong (8/10). Correctly identifies anisotropic aspect ratio, pancake eddies, and Bolgiano-Obukhov physics. Missing explicit statement about w's large-scale mean convergence to zero.

## Attempt 2

Exponents: Half credit - mathematically correct but missed unobservability of negative Hurst exponents
Explanation: Solid understanding of stratified turbulence physics, correctly identifies Bolgiano-Obukhov regime and aspect ratio scaling, but lacks mention of w's mean converging to zero

# Sonnet 4.5 Nonthinking

## Attempt 1

Exponents: 0/10 (all four exponents incorrect). Explanation: 2/10 (mentions stratification but misses aspect ratio scaling, doesn't compute w from incompressibility correctly)

## Attempt 2

Exponents: All four incorrect; assumed w inherits u's scaling directly.
Explanation: Mentions Bolgiano-Obukhov/stratification but misses negative Hurst exponents, aspect ratio scaling, and w's large-scale convergence.

# GPT-5-Pro

## Attempt 1

Exponents: Half credit (energy spectra correct; missed that negative Hurst exponents make structure functions non-scaling/exponent=0).
Explanation: Strong - correctly identifies Bolgiano-Obukhov, anisotropy (χ=5/9), incompressibility constraint. Missing: explicit aspect ratio-size relation, w-mean convergence, Lovejoy/Schertzer references.

# Opus 4.1

## Attempt 1

Exponents: Poor (wrong signs on spectra, missed H<0 issue). Explanation: Adequate (correct aspect ratio, but missed Bolgiano-Obukhov/buoyancy flux frameworks).

## Attempt 2

Exponents: 0/10 (all four exponents completely incorrect). Explanation: 4/10 (mentions Bolgiano-Obukhov and buoyancy correctly, but missing aspect ratio scaling)

# GPT-5-thinking

## Attempt 1

Exponents: All four quantitative results incorrect; failed to recognize w's anti-persistence from incompressibility constraint.
Explanation: Mentions Bolgiano-Obukhov and anisotropy but misses key physics: w's negative Hurst exponent, aspect ratio scaling, and pancake-like geometry.

## Attempt 2

Exponents: All four wrong (copied u exponents to w without applying incompressibility constraint). Explanation: Mentions Bolgiano-Obukhov (good) but misses aspect ratio scaling and pancake-like eddies; doesn't explain why w differs from u.

## Attempt 1

Exponents: 0/4 correct - all four exponents are wrong

Explanation: Generic stratified turbulence discussion, not derived from problem

# Gemini 2.5 Pro

## Attempt 1

Exponents: All four incorrect - simply copied u scalings instead of deriving w from incompressibility.

Explanation: Mentions B-O but completely misses the core physics - no aspect ratio scaling, no w→0, wrong application of B-O. Fundamentally misunderstood the problem.

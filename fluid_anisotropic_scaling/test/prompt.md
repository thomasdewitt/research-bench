An incompressible fluid obeying the Euler equations, and is immersed in a gravitational field pointing in z direction, is found to be scale invariant with \Delta u(\Delta x)\sim \Delta x^{1/3} and \Delta u(\Delta z)\sim \Delta z^{3/5} (where these are structure functions, i.e. average absolute differences). What does this imply about the kinetic energy spectra for w and structure functions for w? Only return these four results for this section. After that, provide a physical explanation of what is going on.

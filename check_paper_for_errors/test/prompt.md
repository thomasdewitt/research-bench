I am submitting Vertical-turbulence-test.pdf to a journal. Terminal Output.txt is the output of the script used to generate all the figures used in Vertical-turbulence-test.pdf and its supplement. confirm that all of the values the script is outputting have been correctly copied into the manuscript and supplement. Please only return a bulleted list, where each entry contains the line number and error. If there are none just say "No errors". Don't include what is correct.

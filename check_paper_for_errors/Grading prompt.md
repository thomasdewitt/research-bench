I have an LLM test where it is supposed to find all the errors in a couple of PDFs. I have attached the solution and will paste the LLM's output below. Compare the output to the solution to determine the LLM's score. Report back the following numbers:

- Number correct out of the total in the solution set

- Number of incorrectly identified errors - i.e. errors the LLM reported that are not in the solution

Below is the output from the LLM:

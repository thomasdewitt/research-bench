There are some cases in this directory, each consisting of a number of 2D binary arrays, with regions of value 1 perhaps representing clouds. Each case was generated using a random process with identical statistics within each case but statistics that differ between cases. Your task is to determine the size distribution of the clouds. If the clouds are power-law distributed, then calculate the power-law exponent τ such that dn/da ~ a^-(τ+1) where a is the object area. Fill in solution.csv with your answers, with the first col is_scaling boolean and the second col exponent is τ as a float.

Note that you will have to consider biases arising from the fact that the arrays have finite resolution and finite size. Check the .pdf for instructions here.

Perform any checks or experiments necessary to ensure that your results are correct.

Task: Cloud Size Distribution Analysis

Given a binary cloud mask, compute the size distribution of cloud objects.

Inputs:
- Binary mask data in test/data/ directory (NumPy array saved as .npy file)

Requirements:
1. Identify connected cloud objects in the binary mask
2. Calculate the size (number of pixels) of each cloud object
3. Compute the size distribution accounting for finite domain effects
4. Output results as a CSV with columns: size, count

Expected output format (solution.csv):
- Column 1: Object size (number of pixels)
- Column 2: Count (number of objects with that size)

Notes:
- Use appropriate methods to account for domain boundary effects
- Consider using the objscale package if available
